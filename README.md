CHATGPT GENERATED STEPS:
Certainly, I can guide you through the process of setting up a smart contract using the tools and components you've mentioned. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Install Homebrew**:
   If you haven't already, install Homebrew on your Mac. Open Terminal and run:
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

2. **Install Python Virtual Environment**:
   Set up a virtual environment for your Python projects:
   ```bash
   brew install python3
   pip3 install virtualenv
   virtualenv vyper_env
   source vyper_env/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Vyper**:
   Install Vyper within your virtual environment:
   ```bash
   pip install vyper
   ```

4. **Install Node.js and npm**:
   Install Node.js and npm using Homebrew:
   ```bash
   brew install node
   ```

5. **Install Hardhat**:
   Install Hardhat globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g hardhat
   ```

6. **Create GitHub Repo**:
   Create a new repository on GitHub where you'll store your smart contract project.

7. **Clone Repo and Set Up Project**:
   Clone your GitHub repository and navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

8. **Initialize Hardhat Project**:
   Initialize a Hardhat project and follow the prompts:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat
   ```

9. **Write Smart Contract**:
   Use Vyper to write your ERC-721 smart contract. Place the `.vy` file in the `contracts` directory of your Hardhat project.

10. **Compile and Deploy**:
    Use Hardhat to compile and deploy your contract. Update the deployment scripts in the `scripts` directory to match your contract's deployment.

11. **Configure Mainnet and llamarpc**:
    Configure your Hardhat project to connect to the Ethereum mainnet using an Alchemy or Infura API. Update the `hardhat.config.js` file.

12. **Test and Interact**:
    Write tests for your smart contract using Hardhat's testing framework. Use Hardhat's console to interact with your deployed contract on the mainnet.

13. **Set Up Ape**:
    If you want to use Ape for front-end development, follow Ape's documentation to set up the development environment.

14. **Code Review and Security Audit**:
    Before deploying your contract, consider getting a code review and security audit to ensure its correctness and safety.

Please note that this is a general outline, and the actual steps may vary based on specific project requirements and changes to tools since my last update in September 2021. Always refer to the official documentation of the tools and platforms for the most accurate and up-to-date instructions.
